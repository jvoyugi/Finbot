# Finbot chatbot
### Starting up
To start the bot, simply reply to the greeting, e.g. `hello`
### Other commands
1. Any phrase referring to saving will take you to saving tips. You can ask `I want to know how to save`. If you want more tips you just reply with a positive feedback e.g. `ok`. To stop just reply with `thanks` or `I appreciate`.
2. Any phrase concerned with credit score will take you to credit score information. E.g `What is a credit score`.
3. To end a conversation just reply with any conversation enders like `goodbye`.

Since it is an MVP many features haven't been added yet.
